# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Gesture-Recognition

This is a course project, the course is MIE324 at University of Toronto. If you are a student of this course and find this project is similar to one of the projects you got (although I don't think this project will be used again), please contact me and I will make this project to be private. Thank you!

This project contains a CNN model trained to classify letter gestures (out of the 26 english letters). The data are generated by the 2018-2020 class of Machine Intelligence Option of Division of Engineering Science at University of Toronto. I'm a member of this class and the performance of the model I built won the third place (in terms of accuracy) in the class. In fact, this model is the first CNN model I built.
